        <br>
        <p>My name is John Brosius, I teach at Davenport West High School teaching computer science courses and business courses. I received my Bachelor
             of Science in Business Administration with a concentration in management in 2002. I started teaching myself technical skills that have led me to my career today. 
             I first taught myself HTML and CSS in 2010, followed up with Java. 

        </p>
        <br>
        <p>Currently I teach the following dual enrollment courses through Scott Community College. C#, C++, Java, CSA Java, and Web Development
             (CSS, HTML, and JavaScript). I am getting a masters at St. Ambrose University for Information Technology Management. </p>
        <br>
        <p>In 2018 I worked at John Deere AVD lab developing a software application that engineers could use to analyze data better using WXD Python. 
            The summer of 2020 I will be working at AgWorks developing my skills for node.js and Amazon Web Service. </p>
        <br>
        <p>The things that drive me is working with teams achieving a goal under high stakes pressure. I design these scenarios within my classes in order to give students the 
            real time stress that employees feel in order to complete projects. The implementation of tools that developers use within the workplace is what I work on for their
             development, so they are career ready once they leave the program that I have created.</p>
